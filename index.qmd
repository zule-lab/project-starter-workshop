# Part I: Prep Work

## Learning Goals

My goal for this workshop is to give everyone the tools to:

::: incremental
-   Confidently start a project in R
-   Manage files in a way that is reproducible and easy to understand
-   Allow people to document progress on their projects
-   Know what they want to learn more about/ask me about in the coming months

## Software Installation

-   **CHECK-IN: does everyone have everything working/installed?**
-   Absolutely the hardest part of this workshop
-   Thank you for doing homework!!

. . .

-   If you have technical issues throughout this presentation - raise your hand and we will either work through together or Kayleigh will help you troubleshoot


## Project Workflow (yours can be different!)

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1]]"}
```{dot}
//| fig-width: 10
//| fig-align: center

digraph G {
    
    bgcolor="transparent"
    node [style=filled,color=white]
    edge [color="lightblue"]
    
    rankdir=RL

    
    clone [shape=box]
    data_cleaning [shape=box]
    commit [shape=box]
    push [shape=box]
    

    GitHub_Repo -> clone;
    clone -> Local_Repo;
    Local_Repo -> RStudio_Project;
    RStudio_Project -> data_cleaning;
    data_cleaning -> commit;
    commit -> push;
    push -> GitHub_Repo;

}
```

# Part II: GitHub

## GitHub & Version Control

::: incremental

- GitHub is a website-software that documents your progress on a project and allows you to do *version control*
  - aka it takes snapshots of your progress across time so nothing gets lost
  
- If you save rough drafts of your writing as you go along - that is version control

- Really useful for when you want to go back/change your mind/re-run a test/etc. 

- Facilitates peace of mind + reproducible science + collaboration/sharing

## The Basics of GitHub

- 5 basic jargon terms you need to know to use GitHub:
  - Repository/repo: your project
  - Clone: make a local copy of your project
  - Commit: describe and commit to any changes you've made
  - Push: send your changes to your online repo
  - Pull: incorporate any changes to your local repo
  - (BONUS branch: a side project)

- *We will do all these things today!*

[ZULE's GitHub](https://github.com/zule-lab) has lots of repositories (including examples) if you are looking for inspiration for folder organization, ReadMe documentation, metadata, etc.

Now you should have an (almost) empty repository/folder on your computer... Let's fill it!
